Hello there! My name is Cole. Currently a U2 Math
<br>
and Computer Science student at McGill.

Excited about the future. I try to spend my free time hiking, <br>
playing guitar, building side projects, reading, writing, <br> and seeing friends. Here's what I'm working on [now](/now).

I'd love if you clicked [here](mailto:cole@colekillian.com) to let me know what brings <br> you here or if you want grab coffee.
