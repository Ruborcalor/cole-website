I was looking for a way to connect to org mode from my phone. My main goals were to:

-   Write todos when away from the computer
-   Read todos when away from the computer
-   Timetracking when away from the computer

In my search I came across the following possible solutions:

[org-web](https://github.com/DanielDe/org-web)
: org-mode on the web, built with React, optimized for mobile, synced with Dropbox and Google Drive.

[Organice](https://github.com/200ok-ch/organice)
: A community driven fork of org-web with the commitment of a Swiss company behind it.

[Orgzly](https://github.com/orgzly/orgzly-android)
: org-mode on android, a native mobile app.

[Beorg](https://beorgapp.com/)
: org-mode on ios, a native mobile app.

[Termux](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13829075)
: Run emacs from termux on android. Not built with mobile in mind.

[Organic](https://github.com/bnankiewicz/organic)
: org-mode on android, a native mobile app; unmaintained.

For me it was easy to narrow down my choice to Organice and Orgzly (I am on Android). At that point it became difficult to decide so I gave both a try. These are my initial impressions:

# Conclusion {#conclusion}

In deciding, its important to keep in mind the goals for using org mode from mobile.

-   Write todos when away from the computer
-   Read todos when away from the computer
-   Timetracking when away from the computer

In keeping with these goals, I prefer Organice because of the capture templates and time clocking. A nicer user experience is an added bonus. Yes, Orgzly has the advantage of better offline support, but I rarely see myself without access to mobile data. Orgzly has the advantage of reminders for upcoming tasks, but I don't rely on these types of reminders from my mobile device.

Keep in mind these are my initial impressions. My plan is to go with Organice for a few weeks and report back with anything else I notice.
