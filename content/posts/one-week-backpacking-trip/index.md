Backpacking with friends from Highschool, Soren and Thomas.

Soren and Thomas had backpacked before, but it was my first time.

We hiked just about 100 miles over the course of 7 days!


# Preparation {#preparation}

-   I found my backpacking backpack on the side of the road left out for the trash. At first we weren't sure if it was going to cut it, but it worked out fine in the end (although it was heavy, creeked a lot, put a sharp pressure on hips, and fabric coming apart onto anything you put into the bag).


# Day 1 {#day-1}

-   Woke up at 7. Soren, Thomas, and I had done a practice camping on the roof of my house.
-   We drove over to Soren's house where we had eggs for breakfast.
-   Laurentiu is driving. Quite the character. I remember there was one close incident, but can't remember exactly what it was.
-   Stop at a gas station on the way where I get this notebook. I'm so glad I did.
-   Arrive at the trail head. We start off, ready to go.
-   The parents hike along behind us for about 30 minutes, but they can't keep up. We are on our own!
-   I wear a single shirt and pants for the 7 days.
-   We reach the summit of the first ascent. It's the top of a ski lift. Beautiful. Change from pants to shorts.
-   We see a trail resorer. We chat with him for a bit. He has a machette that he cuts down trail obstructions with. He notices our high morals and says that our morals are high because we haven't gotten wet yet.
-   We go down from the ski lift. We see a pack of 6 girls. I didn't realize this was the first day. They were going to the opposite direction. One of them was wearing a McGill shirt so I said "wow I got to McGill too".
-   After we pass them I start saying "We should've asked...", but then stop myself because I realize that I was trying to spread the "blame" when really it was entirely up to me to ask them a question. I wanted to ask them the details of their hike and how it was going.
-   We summit a second mountain and stop for our first snack. Feels really good. We are eating at the top.
-   We find our first stream and filter some water. While filtering water soren got out his ukelele and we started making up some songs together. Good times.
-   We find another bigger stream and take our first swim break. First swim on the first day! We were having a good time. Soren and Thomas had already dunked their heads, so it was my turn. I went for the big plunge, and when I resurface my glasses were missing! This was a relatively deep river, and the water was mostly clear, but not clear enough for us to find the glasses easily. And the river was flowing pretty strongly so we were afraid they could get pushed downstream! Soren guarded the downstream exit, while Thomas and I searched for the glasses. We found them! That would have been quite brutal if I had lost my glasses on the first day.
-   We continue to the campsite. Set up the tent. The first freeze dried meals!
-   An old man tells us to stay at this campsie instead of continuing forwards.
-   We eat our meals by the river.
-   Once it gets dark, we skinny dip in the river. It was very shallow so it was more of a pushup and spin move haha. First swim on the first day!
-   We put our food in a nearby bear box.
-   We sleep. Takes me a while to fall asleep, but pretty good.


# Day 2 {#day-2}

-   Wake up and east some musli. It's a food very similar to overnight oats.
-   We pack up the tent. I am trying to squeeze it against the trunk of a tree to speed up the flow of water. A branch punctures the water filter! It's the second morning lol.
-   We continue forward, eventually reaching a lake.
-   Thomas goes swimming nakes. Some rangers pass by and we chat with them while thomas is hiding the lower half of his body in the water. It's difficult though because the lake is super shallow haha. Thomas didn't realize when he was first getting in. What a small world; turns out Thomas and Soren competed against the rangers in the MA sailing team league.
-   We climb a mountain. Thomas calls with crystal. I get a selfie video on top of the mountain using a mini tripod I brought. Glad I brought it.
-   We continue forward. We are ascending a mountain and keep thinking we are about to summit, but we never do.
-   We finally get to the top and find a bunch of stacked rocks. There wasn't much of a view here. We rest for a bit and eat some snacks.
-   We start descending. Soren thinks he saw the shelter so we all get our hopes up, but turns out it was just a really big rock.
-   We are getting quite thirst and are out of water. Soren thinks he sees a river, but it's a mirage. Just some more rocks haha.
-   We find a shelter with gross mosquito water, but it's kind of running. We filter some of it, make a wood fire and cook our meals. We lay down the tent and a tarp.
-   We decide that there is still enough daylight that we want to continue forwards to make up for the below expected miles we hiked on the first day.
-   We are all kind of delerious from the lack of water and are laughing somewhat hysterically at the smallest things. Thomas thinks we are jokin about resuming hiking, but we pack up and go.
-   We find a marking on the ground that says "Pinta People". We discuss for a while what it could possible mean.
-   We find a humongous river like the potomac and fill the big water filter with water but keep going instead of filtering because it is starting to get dark. This is the popped water filter, but we covered the hole with duct tape which works well enough. We want to find the next shelter before the sun sets. We alternate carrying the full water filter.
-   We get lost for a bit trying to find the trail. After going the wrong way for some time, we find our way.
-   We find a highway. Soren said that the shelter should be 1.5 miles past the highway so we are almost there!
-   We keep hiking at a good pace for 2 hours but never find the shelter. We keep thinking that we must be almost there, and keeping mistaking objects for the shelter, but it never comes. We are unsure if we already past is or what the deal is.
-   It is not getting very dark. Pitch black in fact. Thomas takes the lead with a headlight, and I am in back with a very bright bike light.
-   We are all thirstier than ever before. We finally stop and consume the water we have been carrying in the water filter. We wanted to wait till camb, but it looks like that isn't going to happen.
-   We drink some water and decide to stop for the night, thinking we passed the shelter (we hiked what must have been 5 miles).
-   We find a side trail named "lake loop" and follow it in search of water. The next day we realize that the a lake used to be there, but that it is all dried up.
-   The loop is longer than we thought. We aren't finding water and decide to stop and setup camp in the middle of a pitch black forest where we have no idea where we are. I think I may have been a bit grumpy.
-   We find a small patch off the trail. Not quite flat or root free but good enough.
-   We setup the tent. Everyone gets in. It smells horrible haha.
-   I find a bit of wtare left in my camel pack and devour it secretly without sharing haha. It's enough water for me to fall asleep.
-   Part of the reason we want to find a shelter so badly is that they have bear boxes where you can hide you food. In this case we leave our bags outside so that if a bear comes, at least it doesn't eat us, just our bags. We had really been manifesting a bear while walking in the dark, thinking any noise could be the bear coming.
-   Sleepytime.


# Day 3 {#day-3}

-   Wake up to Soren and Thomas.
-   We pack up the tent. I take my first poo and use the emergen wipes. Very peaceful to poo in the forest.
-   Hit the trail. 20 minutes later we fid the shelter. We were so close! Looking at the map we see that it was 5.5 miles from the highway after all, not 1.5...
-   We stop to fill up on water. There is a very nice stream with a grey pipe that makes filtering the water very easy despite the shallowness of the stream.
-   Cook some freeze dried food for breakfast. Tastes sooo good.
-   I setup the tripod and take some videos. We are having a good time, but then the phone runs out of battery unfortunately.
-   We hear moose noises.
-   Thomas discovers that he missplaced the charging cable so no more phone. I'm bummed cause it's too bad not to be able to take photos.
-   Everyone uses the mens. Mine is a bit messy. Flies are quick to attack. Thank God for emergen wipes lmao.
-   Hit the rode. We summit a very pretty forest. We almost set up the hammock but don't.
-   We find a gorge. It's beautiful.
-   We all swim around to cool off and clean our selves. The first somewhat deep swimming location. Water is cold but feels amazing. There are some tourists there because the gorge is about 5 minutes from road access, so we keep our underwear on.
-   We take lunch break #1. Spend some time patching up food blisters. They are quite bad.
-   We keep hiking and cross a highway.
-   We stop to fill up water at a stream. After the previous experiences, we do not want to be stuck without water again. We eat lunch break #2 at the stream. It is super relaxing.
-   We continue onwards and arrive at the shelter. It is still pretty early in the day with sunlight.
-   There is a beautiful privy and river.
-   We setup a campfire and get food ready. Then we take bathe in the shallow river. My blisters are not fans. Walking around bearfoot. The water is freezing, but we dry off by the fire.
-   We put our food in the lockable privy.
-   Relax by the fire, play some ukelele, and go to bed.


# Day 4 {#day-4}

-   Onwards. Everyone uses the privy.
-   We hike up killington mountain. It's absolutely incredible. The tallest summit yet.
-   There is a really cool shelter with bunk beds that we check out.
-   We find another person. He thought we were bears or something.
-   My joints are really starting to get angry with me. Doesn't like.
-   Thomas thinks there might be a restaurant on top and begins manifesting it, desperate to find it, but Soren protests because it would cut into the daylight.
-   Find a way to get higher by climbing a platform at the top. Kinda sketch, with a lot of floor boards missing, but we navigate our way up and enjoy the view.
-   We cross a highway. There is a nice inn where backpackers can normally stop for a warm meal and bed, but it is closed because of Covid. We do take the opportunity to throw out whatever trash we had, and find a person with cute dogs which we pet.
-   We keep hiking and find a nice overlook where we setup a hammock and relax. First round of popping blisters.
-   We meet a stranger and chat with her a bit. Seems nice. She is on a mission to drive to hiking trails in 6 states or something like that.
-   We find an official campsite. It has running water! What incredible technology!
-   They have beach volley ball courts. We pretend to play without a ball. Good times.
-   We keep going and find an awesome lake. Actually swimmable. It's a very hard choice to decide whether we stay here or keep going. Soren convinces us to make up the 2 remaining miles in the day tomorrow.
-   We swim across the lake to an island in the middle. We are manifesting snapping turtles, but luckily none appear. There are some musical toads on the island in the middle. I lag behind because I'm afraid for my blisters, but I make it across. There are some kayakers. And a boy fishing. What a different life it would be to live out here.
-   We come back and dry off while cooking food. We eat and then sleep. In the tent Thomas notices that some green stuff has invaded his blisters. He's not sure if they came from the lake or how they got there. He's a bit stressed about it, but Soren tells him not to worry about it (because Soren wants to go to sleep). We all go to bed.


# Day 5 {#day-5}

-   We continue onwards.
-   Pass by some construction workers and try to ask them for some food, but either they completely ignored us, or couldn't hear us. It's chill though.
-   We find a lake dock and walk out on it but it is somewhat falling apart and starts sinking as we walk out. Good times.
-   We hike through an awesome forest with lots of big rocks.
-   We stop at a river for a snack.
-   There is a steep descent off a rock with a ladder to help you out. Soren just jumps down. No injury.
-   I realize I lost my sleeping pad! I go back to look for it, but can't find it... Alas...
-   We cross a bridge and find some old dudes chilling out by the river. They offer us some trail magic! Pretzels, doritos, lolly pops, and some other snacks. Very cool. They said that hikers were a lot less frequent because of Covid.
-   I take the lead and go full speed up this mountain. I'm sweating like balls and exhausted but I just keep pushing. I keep telling myself 30 more steps. Soren and Thomas are barely keeping up and keep asking me to slow down, but I really just want to get to the top. The thing is that the top never comes haha. Eventually we stop for lunch before we reach the top, even though I protest, saying that we'll get a better view with which to eat lunch once we get to the top. It's chill though. Looking out at the forest is nice too.
-   After lunch we keep going and we do reach the top. It's incredible! This is the highest summit so far I think.
-   There is a shelter at the top of the mountain with a ladder to the roof. This shelter you can actually rent out, but it's open to backpackers when nobody is staying. It finally clicked why the trail to this shelter was so much more well maintained than the rest of the AT. I guess they don't want it to be too hard for the less intense people who rent out the shelter.
-   We climb the ladder onto the roof. There are lots of bees on the top. We take some photos, and give each of our parents a call.
-   Inside the cabin we find snickers, a pop tart, and pistachios! That snickers was the best snickers I've ever had.
-   "leave behind nature valley". Not sure what this is.
-   We go down the mountain and find the next shelter. Unfortunately we can't find any water nearby. Just a dried up river. We keep looking and I find some eventually a bit further downstream.
-   We fill up all of our water packs and make dinner. Then we take it back to the shelter and eat there.
-   We almost start a fire but decide to go to bed instead. We do a rotated sleeping pad strategy because I lost mine so we only have two left.


# Day 6 {#day-6}

-   We pack up at shelter.
-   I take a poo in the privy with the door open looking out onto all the trees.
-   We hike for a while. We walk through a farm and find cows! They come right up to us and swarm us on all sides and really like being pet. They seem very interested in us. I was a bit afraid at first but in the end nobody got there fingers bit off. The cows had a bunch of flies in their eyes which was a bit unnerving, but it's cool.
-   Eventually we continue fowards. We stop at a brooke and make a freeze dried lunch.
-   Lots of breaks in the canopy today which makes everything much hotter than it already was.
-   We roll down a hill.
-   Giant mini forests where there are a bunch of plants that look like trees, but only go up to waste height. Really makes you feel like a giant.
-   We stop in the forest and setup the hammock. Nice to relax. Soren and I finish off our peanut butter jars.
-   I go in the hammock and it feels amazing.
-   We keep going towards west hartford, the "big town" of the trip. We fantisize about what we'll find in the town.
-   We find some trail magic sodas which gives us the sugar rush to climb up a mountain.
-   We make it to the last road. This is the longest we walk on a road.
-   We try to find a gas station or restaurant but fail to map food.
-   We meet a friendly family who had just gone swimming and offers us some sodas. We ask if there is a gas station nearby but they say it is about 10 minutes by car which is wayy too far.
-   We find a library with wifi, an ice cream store and a post office. The ice cream store is closed because of covid. The post office has the functionality of letting you ship yourself care packages as you hike along.
-   We find a house with an "AT" sign on it. We check it out and find a friendly woman who gives us soda and says we can camp in her backyard for the night, and use her hose for tap water.
-   We setup camp/tenta nd bring food and water to the river across the road. It's huge! By far the deepest.
-   We find some locals bridge jumping. e join in. The water is very warm. Bridge jumping is awesome.
-   After the bridge jumping we start making dinner. The locals find it funny that we are cooking food and spending the night at their local swimming location.
-   They leave. We eat and washup with soap.
-   Go to bed looking at the stars because we don't expect it to rain. Excited to see parents the next day.


# Day 7 {#day-7}

-   The last day. We get a bit lost, but eventually find our way. We are mostly walking on roads. Then mine and Soren's mom find us with the car. The timing was perfect. They brought loads of fast food which was incredible.
-   We drive into town and eat lunch at a restaurant. Human food!
-   We visit Soren's chilhood home.
-   The plan is to stay one more night so the parents can camp with us. I am going back home, but Soren and Thomas are continuing for another week more!
-   We camp next to a nice lake that Thomas and Soren will be starting from the next day. We don't go swimming, but walk around the perimeter. It's great. We see this dude with a drone.
-   We go to bed. The next day Soren and Thomas continue forwards, and the rest of us head home. The drive home was very relaxing.


# Reflections {#reflections}

-   I keep reading the notes and can't believe how early in the trip they occurred. A similar thing happens when I take courses at school. I wonder why this is.
-   We kept manifesting a bear, but it was irrational of us to be so afraid. The fear made the backpacking more fun in some ways though.
-   We were surprised at how little wild life we saw. Our footsteps must have been load enough to scare them all away.
-   It's incredible what a new experience you can have in such a short period of time. This was just one week, but it was experience like none I've ever had.
-   I regret not taking a photo of the before and after backpack.
-   I regret not taking more photos.
-   I'm really glad I journaled throughout the trip. There's no way I would have remembered even a quarter of these things otherwise.
-   We got very lucky with the weather. No rain the whole time.
-   We Very rarely see people. Maybe one person a day on average.
