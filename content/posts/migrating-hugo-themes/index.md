Previously I was using a combination of [monopriv](https://themes.gohugo.io/theme/monopriv/) and [pickles](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo_theme_pickles/) themes for hugo.

I started out with monopriv but soon after realized I wasn't the biggest fan of the single.html or list.html styling. I think I initially chose this theme because I was a fan of the homepage layout, but I now realize that the least important aspect when choosing a theme is the homepage as it is the easiest to personalize.

I wanted to start posting and searched for a theme whose blog styling I prefered, landing on Ppickles. I then hackily combined the two themes, trying to keep the homepage of monopriv and the posting style of pickles. It lead to a kind of frankenstein where the header and footer would change based on the page you would view among other things.

Now, two days ago, I started from scratch with the theme LoveIt. They seemed like a nice foundation to build off of, with dark/light mode, prebuilt shortcodes, and a table of contents. I ended up modifying the css in many ways in order for posts to have more of a Medium style, but kept 

I hope I won't make any major changes for the next while. Instead of posting I tended to work on the site but hopefully I won't have that excuse anymore. My goal is to start writing 30 minutes a day. Time will tell if I can keep this up.

Initially I wanted to use a less common theme and modify it how I saw fit. I used to spend lots of time customizing things personally, but I'm moving more into a pragmatic mindset where I just want things to work. That being said I still see myself as customizing more than the average person.
