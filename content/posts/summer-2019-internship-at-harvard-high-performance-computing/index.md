# High Level Overview {#high-level-overview}

I intered at Harvard HPC for 12 weeks (High Performance Computing) the summer of 2019.

I lived with my family and would bike to and from work (about 15 minutes) each day.

My work focused around improving support for tracking client storage allocations. I was lucky to work alongside lots of awesome and brilliant colleagues. :)


# What Did I Learn {#what-did-i-learn}


## Skills {#skills}

-   I learned Django, MySQL, and Docker
-   Learned about the all of the communication involved with designing the structure of a new database.


## Lessons {#lessons}

-   Don't iterate through designs by coding them; instead use a tool like Figma and then code it once you settle on a design.


# What Did I Get Done {#what-did-i-get-done}

Here is an overview of the things I was most proud of accomplishing:

-   Coded a dashboard that enables Harvard FASRC clients to view, request, or terminate their storage allocations.
-   Built a storage request form that helps streamline the process by which clients acquire more storage.
-   Designed a MySQL database for tracking storage allocations and storage transactions.


# Thanks {#thanks}

This experience would not have been possible without the many awesome colleagues I got to work alongside. Special thanks to Raminder for being such a great mentor this past summer. This was my first software engineering internship; I wouldn't have grown and learned as much as I did without your constant feedback.
