# Keepass

[Keepass](https://keepass.info/) is an awesome open source password manager. That being said,while the security is top notch, I haven't fallen in love with the user interface. I don't want to have to click my mouse around multiple times just to enter a password.

# Keepmenu

This is where [keepmenu](https://github.com/firecat53/keepmenu) comes in. It is a "Fully featured Dmenu/Rofi frontend for managing Keepass databases". You read right, Dmenu/Rofi! This means it can looks sexy while leaving minimal friction between you and your passwords.

# Screenshots

The three main functionalities you need from a password manager are:

1. Authenticating
