For the past year, the lectures for my courses have been given over zoom because of Covid.

My first reaction to online school is to dislike it, because it feels like a lot of the value is removed by not having courses in person.

But over the last year i've realized that I prefer learning material via recordings than I do learning material live.

Disclaimer: my thoughts are tailored towards computer science and math courses, because those are the courses that I take.


# What are the main components of school? {#what-are-the-main-components-of-school}

There's two main ways schools are handling covid:

-   nobody allowed on campus
-   limited people allowed on campus

The point of going to school is to grow as a person whether it be through technical knowledge, self-sufficiency, .

How does covid affect this process?

School being online is a subcategory of the consequence of covid.

What does school being "online" mean? There are a few different components that we might want to isolate:

-   No requirement for attending lectures live / no option to attend lectures live
-   Exams are open note and written at home

That's it. That is what "online school" means. No, this is wrong. These are the appealing parts of online school. But it also means:

-   no in person activities

There are lots of other consequences

Envision a future taking from the best of both worlds.

We want to isolate school

Good things about school being online:

-


-   less commuting
-   less commuting

# Live vs Recorded Consumption {#live-vs-recorded-consumption}

When consuming a live lecture, you have to shape your brain to the pace of the lecture. This is problematic because it is unlikely that the lecture's pace and your natural pace are the same by coincidence. For example, the prof may tailor the pace of the lecture to that of the average person of the class. This leaves lots of people with non optimal pace. Nobody is average ([link](https://www.thestar.com/news/insight/2016/01/16/when-us-air-force-discovered-the-flaw-of-averages.html)).

When recorded, you can consume the lecture at your preferred pace. You can speed it up, slow it down, pause, start, take breaks. This can enable the time spent learning material to be much more efficient.

A good thing about live lectures is that they don't require as much will power. For recorded lectures you are left to manage your own time, while for live lectures you are forced to go to class and keep up the pace or else you won't get access to the lectures.


# Preparation and Consumption {#preparation-and-consumption}

There are two factors. Preparation and Consumption.

It is hard to prepare a live lecture. Everything has to be done live; there isn't an undo button.

With recordings, a lot of post processing can be added in order to improve the quality of a lecture. Jump cutter. Auto post processor idea.


# Pros of Recordings {#pros-of-recordings}

Questions:


# What do I think about online school? {#what-do-i-think-about-online-school}

Pros:

-   no commute
-   3x lecture recordings.

When school was in person, I didn't go to a lot of the classes anyways if I thought my time would be better spent else where. Why go to lecture when you can watch the recording at 3x speed later.

Cons:

-   can't go to the gym
-   working on problem sets in person

The right roommates solve the problems of online school. You have someone to work on problem sets with so that the class doesn't feel as alone.

I like the flipped classroom format. I think lectures can be done best with recordings, because you aren't interacting anyways. Discussion on the other hand needs to be live. It's actually easier to do flipped classroom over zoom because you don't need a classroom with breakout tables.

Why do I want covid to go away?
