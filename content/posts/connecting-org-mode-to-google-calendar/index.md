title = "Connecting Org Mode to Google Calendar"

I was getting ready for university to start, and was organizing my schedule. Last year I had taken care of this with Google Calendar, but that was a version of me before I had discovered org mode.

Initially my instinct was to go for Google Calendar again, and find a way to sync it with my org agenda. This could be helpful in other ways as well. When emails add events to google calendar, it would automatically sync it to my org agenda.

When researching for potential ways of integrating, I came across old [org-gcalc](https://github.com/myuhe/org-gcal.el), new I discovered [org-gcalc](https://github.com/kidd/org-gcal.el/).

It was not too difficult to setup.

I was able to add my course schedules to google calendar and sync it to my org agenda.

It was at that point that I began wondering why I couldn't just directly add events to my org agenda. What's the point of using google calendar?

Potential points for google calendar integration:

-   Better mobile support (although I need to look more into org mode mobile solutions)

Potential points against google calendar integration:

-   Maybe I should be scheduling tasks myself instead of letting gmail take care of it. It would take marginally more effort, but potentially would help me remember the event better.
-   Using google calendar would only mean less effort if I stopped using some org features like tagging.

Current position:

-   Look into mobile support and see how hard it is to schedule tasks from mobile

If it is easy:

-   I'm going to use native org mode for scheduling my own tasks

If it is hard:

-   I'll use google calendar for scheduling tasks on the go, and might as well use it for everything? Maybe not.

Try to remove biases when making these decisions.
