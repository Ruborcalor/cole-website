# The Idea

The other day my brother were at home depot, and began discussing the concept of putting things back where they belong when shopping.

This lead us to two types of people:

1. Those who pick up an item and put it back where they found it or return it to cash register.
2. Those who pick up an item and put it down in a random location at their own convenience.

I will list the just pros of each because they are pretty much inverse to one another (the cons of one are the pros of the other)

At first glance this categorization seemed rather pointless, but then I realized its potential correlation with the types of actions a person would make in the [prisoner's dilemma](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/prisoners-dilemma.asp), a paradox in decision analysis in which two individuals acting in their own self-interests do not produce the optimal outcome. In the case of putting things back, you always gain in the moment by putting something down at your own convenience, but the optimal outcome is reached by putting it back in its proper position. We can let "cooperate" mean putting something back where it belongs, and "betray" mean put it back at your own convenience.

## Cooperating

- Saves employees time
- Sense of satisfaction

## Betraying

- Adds significantly more work for employees
- Potentially allows the store to gain insight into costumer habits

# Contrasting with library

# Which are you?

I began exploring the reasons by which a person might make one decision or the other, starting my own motivations.

I tend to cooperate. While I may lose out in the moment, I justify it in the following ways: 

- Acting as a role model may improve my own future shopping experiences. 
- As a human it feels good to think you are doing the "right thing".

Elaborating on the first point, the assumption is that the probability of another person cooperating is a function of whether or not I cooperate. i.e. my action of putting something back where it belongs actually increases the number of people who put things back where they belong. This enables me to be selfish believing that the long term positive effect of cooperating outweights the short term loss.

The second point is more superficial. Simply that it feels good to believe I am doing the right thing.

Both of these reasons are selfish, yet they lead me to cooperate.

# On Selfless vs Selfish

At first thought one may think selflessness and selfishness to be traits that obviously correlate with the "cooperate" and "betray" actions. 

However I don't see them this way. I see people as always taking the selfish action. The question becomes what fundamental trait makes people decide differently on which action to take selfishly.

One possibility is a person's belief in the ability of strangers to have a positive effect on their own lives. For those who doesn't believe that they can have much of an impact on other people, and that other people won't have that large of an impact on his life, the justifications I list above become rather worthless, pushing them in the direction of betraying.

Another import consideration is discipline. Whether or not you act the same in a "hot" state as you would in a "cold" state.

Thanks for tuning in. Let me know if you can think of more contributing factors below!
