There was a boy who wanted to find the perfect strategy for heating hot chocolate. His weapon of choice was the microwave, but he had to find how long to radiate it for.

He began microwaving his hot chocolate, first for 30 seconds, then for 15, and then for smaller and smaller increments as he approached the perfect temperature. Each time he would take it out, and give it a taste to check on his progress.

Finally he arrived at the perfect temperature. He knew didn't want to have to repeat this process the next time, so he summed up the duration over which he had microwaved the hot chocolate, and arrived at 122 seconds. Excited to make use of his discovery, he began preparing another hot chocolate right away!

This time he put it in the microwave for 122 seconds all at once, and couldn't wait for what he would find on the other side. As soon the ding sounded he pulled it out, smiled at his creation, took a large gulp... and promptly gave a yelp while spitting it out all over the floor and counter top! It was scaldingly hot! He was in disbelief!

The boy didn't know what had gone wrong. He double and triple checked his math, and it all added up. 122 seconds should have resulted in the perfect hot chocolate temperature.

He then realized his fatal mistake: assuming that intermitantly microwaving the hot chocolate for a total time of 122 seconds would have the same effect as microwaving it for 122 seconds all at once. Of course the process of turning the microwave on and off several times during the process would have an effect on the final temperature. And it only then occured to him that he would have to recalibrate his measurement for different types of microwaves and power settings.

During all his future adventures, he would have this in mind. Never forget to account for control variables.

Moral of the story, is that sometimes, things go wrong because of things you dismissed as be negligible. It's important to keep eyes open. Kinda a fun story.

I thought I'd start of by sharing a random story from childhood. It all started when I was trying to brew the perfect hot chocolate. Being around 8 years old, I figured that if I got the formula down once, I would be set for life! So what did I do? Thinking the ratio of chocolate power to milk to be of less importance, I focused on getting the perfect temperature. So I stood in front of the microwave, and microwaved my glass of hot chocolate one to three seconds at a time, and giving it a temperature test after each trial. I was making sure to sum up the total number of seconds that the hot chocolate had been in the microwave for. Finally, after around 90 seconds of time in the microwave, I had arrived at the perfect temperature! I felt like the king of the world, and went to test out my results by brewing a hot chocolate for my sister. This time I figured I would put it in for 90 seconds all at once. You may be able to see what is coming. I pulled the hot chocolate out after 90 seconds, and gave it a big sip! I promptly spit it out all over the floor and counter top. It was scalding (i'm pretty sure my mouth was tingling for the next few days)! At first I didn't understand what had gone wrong. Honestly I don't know how long it took to realize. But looking back now, I see that the difference was all the time spent between the microwave runs during the first experiment.

What is the moral of the story? It's funny because this happened to me recently, but I was a little more clever about it. This time I performed binary search. Altering the time in the microwave every day that I made oatmeal, trying to hone in on the perfect timing. So far, this has been a failure. I wasn't doing a good enough job of monitoring the control variables.
